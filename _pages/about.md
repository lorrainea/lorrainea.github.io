My current work lies in the creation of algorithms and data structures with applicatios in computational molecular biology. Specifically, this involves identifying and creating algorithms which can aid biological research. I also work on string algorithms with applications in pattern matching and sequence comparison.

#### Tools I have helped to design, implement and maintain:
[MARS](https://github.com/lorrainea/mars) - a heuristic tool for multiple circular sequence alignment given a set of circular sequences.

[CNEFinder](https://github.com/lorrainea/CNEFinder)- a tool for the identification of conserved non-coding elements in genomes.

[hCED](https://github.com/lorrainea/hCED) - a heuristic tool for cyclic edit distance computation given a pair of circular sequences.

[SMART](https://github.com/lorrainea/smart) - a tool to identify supermaximal approximate repeats in a sequence.

[IsoXpressor](https://github.com/lorrainea/IsoXpressor) - a tool to assess transcriptional activity within isochores.
